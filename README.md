# AI-Seach

This project has 2 parts:

 1. In this part the AI uses several search algorithms to find the distances between two cities in India.
 2. The second part also uses several algorithms but to solve the 8 Puzzle Problem.
 
 The search algorithms used are:
  1. DFS
  2. BFS
  3. Bidirectional BFS
  4. A* Algorithm
  5. Greedy Best First Seach Algorithm
 
 Since it is a non-trained simple agent base AI, it will take some time to fetch the results.
